title: Next-gen interactivity for data modeling 
abstract: >

    We are creating capabilities for modelers and data scientists to 
    exploit diagnostics earlier in their model building dev cycle. Visualizations 
    are not just for the end results! The process of model development needs 
    more attention from visual diagnostic tools. We have a fledgeling 
    GUI, extensions to Matplotlib, and some exciting examples that we want to 
    push into Jupyter. We want more community input on these ideas.  [`fovea`](https://github.com/robclewley/fovea)
