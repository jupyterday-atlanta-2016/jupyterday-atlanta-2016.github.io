    In my research, I often want to explore a design space, sweeping out several 
    parameter values to see which one delivers the best performance across a 
    suite of trials. Extracting insight from hundreds of simulator output 
    files is time consuming and error-prone. Visualizing the results of many 
    experiments at once is the fastest way to validate the results and get 
    feedback from my research group. In this talk I will showcase my end-to-end 
    solution for visualizing simulation results with Jupyter notebook. The 
    pandas and seaborn libraries are used to interactively generate 
    paper-ready plots that are automatically labeled with the correct 
    parameter names from the source data.
    
    In this short talk, audience members with a basic understanding of plotting 
    in Jupyter will learn how to streamline the process of extracting, labeling, 
    and visualizing data from raw text files.
