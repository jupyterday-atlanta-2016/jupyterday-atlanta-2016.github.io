title: JupyterLab Walkthrough

abstract: >
    The audience should get a tour of the latest features of 
    [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterlab). The audience should learn about the intended 
    path of JupyterLab development and how third party extensions will be added. 
    There is no knowledge requirement, but experience with 
    the existing Jupyter Notebook would be beneficial. The preferred 
    duration would be 25 minutes, plus 5 minutes for questions.

bio: I am a Software Engineer who served 10 years in the US Air Force prior to joining Continuum Analytics in 2015. I started working on project Jupyter in 2013 working on the Octave magic functions, and have since written kernels for Octave, Matlab, and Scilab. I am working full time on JupyterLab, the next generation user interface for the Jupyter Notebook.
