    The Jupyter stack is built from the ground up to be extensible and hackable, but 
    Jupyter is a big planet with many moons. Let's learn about and build tools and 
    approaches for getting started, testing, and distribution of Jupyter extensions. 
    After a run-down of the extension points (sanctioned and otherwise) within the existing 
    architecture, we'll want to hear about existing extensions to the notebook server, 
    the current notebook JS application, nbviewer, and JupyterHub... and start looking at 
    next-generation tools like JupyterLab.
