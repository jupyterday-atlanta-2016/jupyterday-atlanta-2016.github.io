title: Hands On JupyterLab 
bio: I am a Software Engineer who served 10 years in the US Air Force prior to joining Continuum Analytics in 2015. I started working on project Jupyter in 2013 working on the Octave magic functions, and have since written kernels for Octave, Matlab, and Scilab. I am working full time on JupyterLab, the next generation user interface for the Jupyter Notebook.
